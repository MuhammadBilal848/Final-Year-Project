We can also do it this way:

1. Create a module 'Questions Generator' that accepts user's skills,years of experience and job role that he entered into the website.

2. Take skills,years of experience and job role and 'Questions Generator' will generate questions based on these

takes answer and checks if the given answer is correct wrt to the given qs and return the percentage of correctness of the answer.
